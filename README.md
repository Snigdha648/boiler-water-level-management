# Boiler water level indicator
This system indicates the drop in the water level of a boiler and hence safeguards the machine from exploding due to low water levels in the superheating chamber of the boiler. The idea is to use an ultrasonic sensor to check the level of water and display the same using a set of led lights. It also sends an alert to the operator's smartphone so that he can rectify this in time. 
## The system uses:
* Arduino Uno
* Ultrasonic sensor
* Led lights
* bluetooth transmitter
